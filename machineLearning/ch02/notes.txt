 -- mimic how a single neuron in the brain works: it either fires or it doesn't.
 -- example of Supervised Learning

 Rosenblatt's initial perceptron rule is fairly simple and can be summarized by the following steps:
1. Initialize the weights to 0 or small random numbers.
2. For each training sample x(i) perform the following steps:
  a. Compute the output value yË† .
    b. Update the weights.

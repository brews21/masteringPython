Three types of machine learning
- Unsupervised
- Supervised
- Reinforcement

-- Supervised Learning
Is using a data set to predict future outcomes/ data set

Example would be predicting exam results by using previous tests
as the data

-- Reinforcement Learning
Develop a system that improves it self based on the interactions
with the environment. The current state of the environment
contains a "reward" signal. Learning is done by how well that
action was measured by a "reward" function. Learn a series of
actions that maximizes this reward via an exploratory
trial-and-error approach or deliberative planning.

Example would be a chess board, moves are decided by the state
of the board and the reward is the win or lose of the game

-- Unsupervised Learning
dealing with unlabeled or unknown data structures, and we use it
to extract meaningful info with guidance of a known outcome.


Subgroups and Clustering
organising data into meaningful subgroups without
having any knowledge of the group memberships. They may arise
during the analysis stage, defining a group of objects that
share a certain degree of similarity
